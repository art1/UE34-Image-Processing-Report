\section{Introduction - Image Processing for Earth Observation}
Image processing and the analysis of image data plays an important role especially for Earth Observations, but also in other fields related to space applications that make use of images, e.g. optical navigation or optical attitude control systems. In this report, we present a thorough overview of examples for image processing techniques, especially applying examples in Matlab. We focus on colour spaces for images, fourier transforms of basic figures, erosion and delatation and classification.
